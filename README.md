# CS488-Software-Development
This repository contains projects my team and I worked on for my Soft Dev class at Lewis &amp; Clark College. The team consists of Mack Beveridge, Maxwell Levin, James Tostado, Sam Peers Nitzberg, and Lars Mayrand. For this class, we used Pivotal Tracker to track our progress during every sprint. We utilized Extreme Programming, which is a form of software development methodology.

## Sorting Hat
Sorting Hat is a program created to allocate first year students to their respective mandatory first year classes at Lewis & Clark College.
The program uses a modified Hungarian algorithm that takes a cost matrix of variables such as student preferences, sports, age, gender, etc.
The program has a simple UI that allows the user to input CSV files for the data to be parsed. The results are output as a CSV file. The input can work with or without headers. 
The output is a csv file with the results, along with statistics on how well the program ran. Using data from previous years, our program managed to achieve a success rate of over 85% for their first two choices on average, with at a high of over 92%.
The program takes a split second to run, and completes in under a second.
This program allows the college's staff to assign students to their respective mandatory first year classes within minutes, whereas manually it would have taken her over a week. 

## Machi Koro
Machi Koro is a famous board game created in 2012. The project was intended to be a spike for my team, with the goal to get to know and learn to work with each other.
The project is incomplete.
