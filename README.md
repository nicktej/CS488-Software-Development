# CS488-Software-Development
This repository contains projects my team and I worked on for my Soft Dev class at Lewis &amp; Clark College.

## Machi Koro
Machi Koro is a famous board game created in 2012. The project was intended to be a spike for my team, with the goal to get to know and learn to work with each other.
The project unfortunately has not been completed, but I will pick it up from when we left off soon.

## Sorting Hat
Sorting Hat is a program created to allocate first year students to their respective mandatory first year classes at Lewis & Clark College.
The program uses a modified Hungarian algorithm that takes a cost matrix of variables such as student preferences, sports, age, gender, etc.
The program has a simple UI that allows the user to input CSV files for the data to be parsed. The results are output as a CSV file.
My team and I are working on the project and are going through iterations with the customer.
